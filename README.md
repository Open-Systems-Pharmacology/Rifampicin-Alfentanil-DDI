# Rifampicin-Alfentanil-DDI

Modeling of published clinical Rifampicin-Alfentanil-DDI studies for model evaluation.


## Repository files

Within this repository, we distribute a PK-Sim project file containing simulations of published clinical studies used to evaluate the predictive performance of our models regarding the Rifampicin-Alfentanil-DDI, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports.

The reference model repositories can be found here:
